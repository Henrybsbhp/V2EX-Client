Pull requests keep `TTTAttributedLabel` alive. We love getting them from everyone.

Issues are also welcome, but time is a constraint. You're more likely to see collaboration and conversation on a pull request.

## Issue Guidelines

Issues should contain at least:

- specific reproduction steps
- description and/or screenshot of expected behavior
- description and/or screenshot of actual behavior
- any debugging you've done, suspected causes, etc.

Although we'd like to give tons of time to exploring issues, sometimes we can't. Conforming to this style will help the community help you faster.

Stack Overflow is your best resource if you're not sure your issue is a bug.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- All tests should continue to pass
- If your PR fixes a bug, your PR must include an automated test to prove it
- If your PR adds a feature, your PR mustâ€¦
    - include automated tests to define and validate the expected functionality
    - update `README.md` and/or the documentation to describe the feature
- Unfinished PRs exploring an idea are welcome, but please prominently label them as unfinished.
